# playground
This is a project space for code experimentation. Snippets, algorithms, games, or other ideas without a home will go here.

Code developed here may evolve into a proper project or be included into an existing one, but for the most part this should not be used as a space to develop code for other projects.
I am testing out editing others work in Github. Seems neat.
